They entered at the mouth of the yellow Congo River, one of the world's longest rivers that passes through the world's second largest rainforest. This was significant, as the Europeans used their advanced technology, such as rifles to forcibly kidnap locals from their homes to become slaves in the New World. Ports along this river and nearby coast witnessed some of the cruelest human treatment as a major step along the Middle Passage.',

Main source of ivory: the Lomami Concession Company (Kisangani, early 1900s). </i> <br> Arguably one of the most naturally rich regions of the world, the Congo has been exploited by powers from the Global North since the beginnings of the Age of Exploration (1300-1400). Beginning with the Portuguese, European traders ventured through the jungles and captured native people to be sent along the Middle Passage for enslavement in the Americas. The port at Boma, at the mouth of the Congo River, was used for this and as an export site for the ivory trade, which faced an increased demand in the 1800s. Many elephants resided in the eastern regions of the Congo, and further east in Tanzania, that were captured and then traded through this port.',

King Leopold II owned the colony until he reached his deathbed in 1908.
